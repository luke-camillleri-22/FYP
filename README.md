# Explainability of Reinforcement Learning Agents Within Simulated Environments
## By Luke Camilleri

This repo contains the code and data to replicate my Final Year Project

There are two main things to note:

- Please Extract the .zip file within the Food Directory as it contains crucial agent observation data which was too large to push to the repo uncompressed.

- Please import the Unity Package into an empty Unity Scene and install dependencies accordingly.
